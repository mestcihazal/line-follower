# Line Follower
Line follower using color detection with a webcam mounted on a rover instead of IR sensors to follow a colored line.

This repo contains a couple of different line-following algorithms; try each one and experiment with your own!
Different things will work more or less optimally depending on your rover's hardware as well as lighting conditions, how wide your line is, and other variables, so experiment and see what works best for you.
